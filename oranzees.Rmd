This Rmarkdown file documents the development of the Oranzees model. The code-only version to run the model is in the file *main.R* in the same repository.

### Spatial set-up

We first need to set-up a simulated environment where six populations of oranzees live at relative distances that are approximately similar to the six populations of chimpanzees described in Whiten et al., 1999 

We use the R package [imager](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/imager.html) to process a capture from Figure 1 in Whiten et al., 1999.

```{r}
library(imager)

environment <- load.image( "material/Whiten_1999_cap.png")
plot( environment )
```
