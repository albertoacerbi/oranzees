```

This R markdown file documents the development of the Oranzees model (it continues from [06-oranzees.html](06-oranzees.html)). The code-only version to run the model is in the file [main.R](main.R) in the same repository.

### Consolidating main.R

At this point, we have enough material to start to run some extensive tests of the simulations

```{r message=FALSE}
source('main.R')
```

```{r message=FALSE}
my_test <- test_oranzees_1(6000,.1,.7,1,1)
plot_one_run(my_test)
```
