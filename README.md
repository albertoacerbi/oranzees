# Oranzees model

This repository contains the code and document the development of the oranzees model (more information to follow as the project develops).

At the moment, the material is mainly organised in two documents:

* [main.R](main.R): the actual code (so far only the function `set_oranzees_environment()` is present).

* [oranzees.Rmd](oranzees.Rmd): R Markdown file documenting the development of the model.
