# Oranzees model

This repository contains the code and it documents the development of the the oranzees model (more information to follow as the project develops).

The material is organised as follows:

* [01-oranzees.Rmd](01-oranzees.Rmd) to [07-oranzees.Rmd](07-oranzees.Rmd): R Markdown files documenting the development of the model, mainly for "internal" use.

* [test.R](test.R): code-only file to test code  

* [model-description.Rmd](model-description.Rmd): a description of the model after the first stage of the development, and *before* any extensive test.

* [main.R](main.R): the model code, described in [model-description.Rmd](model-description.Rmd)

Plus two folders:

* [material/](material): folder with media used in the Rmd files.

* [output/](output): folder with outputs from simulations used in the Rmd files.
