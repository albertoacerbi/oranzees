# Oranzees model

This repository contains the code and documents the development of the the oranzees model. [model-description.pdf](model-description.pdf) is a good place to start, providing a short description of the model and the main results so far. 

The material is organised as follows:

* [01-oranzees.Rmd](01-oranzees.Rmd) to [06-oranzees.Rmd](06-oranzees.Rmd): R Markdown files documenting the model implementation details, mainly for "internal" use

* [model-description.Rmd](model-description.Rmd): a shorter description of the model.

* [main.R](main.R): code to run the model

* [test.R](test.R): code to run tests

* [test-results.Rmd](test-results.Rmd): results of test after first stage of development

* [extra-results.Rmd](extra-results.Rmd): possible extension of the main results

* [ex]

Plus four folders:

* [material/](material): folder with media

* [output/](output): folder with outputs from simulations used in the process of development

* [output_test/](output_test): folder with outputs from simulations used in the tests

* [sims_for_ms](sims_for_ms): folder with outputs used in the manuscript

* [extra_results](extra_results): folder with output for possible extensions of the main results
