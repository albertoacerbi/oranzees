* [model-description.Rmd](model-description.Rmd): a description of the model after the first stage of the development (see also the output [model-description.pdf](model-description.pdf))

* [main.R](main.R): code to run the model

* [test.R](test.R): code to run tests

* [test-results.Rmd](test-results.Rmd): results of test and modifications of the code after first stage of development

Plus three folders:
