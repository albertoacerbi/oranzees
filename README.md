# Oranzees model

This repository contains the code and documents the development of the the oranzees model.

The material is organised as follows:

* [01-oranzees.Rmd](01-oranzees.Rmd) to [06-oranzees.Rmd](06-oranzees.Rmd): R Markdown files documenting the model implementation details, mainly for "internal" use

* [model-description.Rmd](model-description.Rmd): a shorter description of the model (see also the output [model-description.pdf](model-description.pdf))

* [main.R](main.R): code to run the model

* [test.R](test.R): code to run tests

* [test-results.Rmd](test-results.Rmd): results of test after first stage of development

* [sims-for-ms.Rms](sims-for-ms.Rmd): simulations (and visualisations) used for the manuscript

Plus three folders:

* [material/](material): folder with media

* [output/](output): folder with outputs from simulations used in the process of development

* [output_test/](output_test): folder with outputs from simulations used in the tests
