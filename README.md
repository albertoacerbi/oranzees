# Oranzees model

This repository contains the code and documents the development of the oranzees model (more information to follow as the project develops).

The material is organised as follows:

* [main.R](main.R): the actual code (so far only the function `set_oranzees_environment()` is present).

* [01-oranzees.Rmd](01-oranzees.Rmd) and [02-oranzees.Rmd](02-oranzees.Rmd): R Markdown files documenting the development of the model.

* [test.R](test.R): code-only file to test codes that will end in the R Markdown files.

Plus two folders:

* material/: folder with media used in the Rmd files.

* output/: folder with outputs from simulatiosn used in the Rmd files.
